# Final Greenfoot Project | Jetpack Penguin

Jetpack Penguin is a 2D platformer with you controlling a penguin around with arrow keys (excluding down arrow key). 

**Objective:** Eliminate as many snowmen as possible by firing snowballs ('spacebar') at moving snowmen. 

Snowmen have 3hp and will move faster if they get hit. 
The penguin has 5hp and will get hurt if touching a snowman. 

The game keeps track of the # of snowmen eliminated by a counter on the top-left of the map. If a penguin loses ALL health, a game over screen will be displayed. The screen includes the final score for the player's current game, their high score for ALL games and an option to restart the game if they press 'enter'.

**Good luck!**
